# video-game-transaction-analyzer
Python project from my Comp-Sci 101 course that reads a CSV of video game transactions, filters invalid rows, computes totals and averages, marks popularity tiers, finds top games and top customer, and lets the user export cleaned results to a new CSV via a menu-driven interface.
