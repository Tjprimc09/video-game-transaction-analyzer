1. Start program

2. Prompt user for filename.

	Ask the user to enter the CSV filename.

	If the filename is empty, ask again.

	If the filename does not end with ".csv", add ".csv".

	Try to open the file.

	If the file does not exist, print an error and ask again.

	When the file successfully opens, return the filename.

3. Read transactions from the file.

	Create an empty list for valid transactions.

	Create an empty list for transactions that are not included.

	Use csv.DictReader to read each row of the file.

	For each row:

		If the TransactionID does not start with VG:

			Print that the transaction is excluded.

			Add the row to the not included list.

			Continue to the next row.

		Otherwise attempt the following:

			Convert Price to a float.

			Convert Quantity to an integer.

			Multiply Price and Quantity to calculate Amount.

			Format Amount to two decimal places.

			Add Amount to the row.

			Append the row to the list of valid transactions.

		If a ValueError occurs, print an error message, add the row to the not included list, and continue.

		If a KeyError occurs, print an error message, add the row to the not included list, and continue.

	After processing all rows:

		Print the count of valid transactions.

		Print the count of excluded transactions.

	Return the list of valid transactions.

4. Mark popularity of each transaction.

	For each transaction:

		If Quantity is equal to 1, set Popularity to Low.

		If Quantity is equal to 2, set Popularity to Moderate.

		If Quantity is 3 or greater, set Popularity to Hot Seller.

	Return the updated transaction list.

5. Calculate summary statistics.

	Total Transactions: number of valid transactions.

	Total Revenue: sum of all Amount values.

	Average Spent:

		If there are no transactions, the average is 0.00.

		Otherwise compute sum of Amount values divided by number of transactions.

6. Find top selling games.

	Create a dictionary to store total sales for each GameTitle.

	For each transaction, add its Amount to that game's total.

	Sort the games in descending order by total sales using sorted().

	Print the top three game titles and their total sales.

7. Find top customer.

	Create a dictionary to store total spending by each customer.

	For each transaction, add its Amount to that customer's total.

	Identify the customer with the highest total spending using max().

	Print the customer name and the total amount spent.

8. Save processed data to a new CSV file.

	Create a new filename by adding "processed_" in front of the original filename.

	Write all transactions to this new file using csv.DictWriter.

	Include the header row and all updated fields.

	Notify the user that the file has been saved.

9. Display menu.

	Print the following options:

		1: Display Summary of Statistics

		2: Find Top Selling Games

		3: Find Top Customer

		4: Save Processed Data to CSV

		5: Exit

	Ask the user to enter a choice.

	If the choice is invalid, ask again.
	
	Return choice

10. Route menu selections.

	If the user selects option 1, display summary statistics.

	If the user selects option 2, find top selling games.

	If the user selects option 3, find top customer.

	If the user selects option 4, save processed data.

	If the user selects option 5, print exit message and end the menu loop.

	Otherwise continue asking for menu choices.

11. Main program flow.

	Call the function to get a valid filename.

	Read and process all transactions.

	Mark popularity for each transaction.

	Enter the menu loop where the user can perform different actions.

12. End program.
